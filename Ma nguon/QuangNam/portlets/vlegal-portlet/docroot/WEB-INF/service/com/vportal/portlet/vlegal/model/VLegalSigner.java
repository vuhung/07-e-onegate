/**
 * The model interface for the VLegalSigner service. Represents a row in the &quot;VLegalSigner&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.vportal.portlet.vlegal.model.impl.VLegalSignerImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a v legal signer model instance should use the {@link VLegalSigner} interface instead.
