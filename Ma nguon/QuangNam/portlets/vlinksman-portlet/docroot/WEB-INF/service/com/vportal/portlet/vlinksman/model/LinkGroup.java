 * The model interface for the LinkGroup service. Represents a row in the &quot;LinkGroup&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.vportal.portlet.vlinksman.model.impl.LinkGroupImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a link group model instance should use the {@link LinkGroup} interface instead.
