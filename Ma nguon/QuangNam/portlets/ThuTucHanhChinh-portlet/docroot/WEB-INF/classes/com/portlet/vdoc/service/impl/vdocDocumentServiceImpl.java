 * The implementation of the vdoc document remote service.

 * <p>
 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.portlet.vdoc.service.vdocDocumentService} interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.portlet.vdoc.service.vdocDocumentServiceUtil} to access the vdoc document remote service.

 *
 * <p>
 * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
