 * The model interface for the VcmsDiscussion service. Represents a row in the &quot;VcmsDiscussion&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.vportal.portlet.vcms.model.impl.VcmsDiscussionImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a vcms discussion model instance should use the {@link VcmsDiscussion} interface instead.
