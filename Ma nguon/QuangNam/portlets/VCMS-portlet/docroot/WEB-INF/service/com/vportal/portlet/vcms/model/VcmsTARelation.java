 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.vportal.portlet.vcms.model.impl.VcmsTARelationImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a vcms t a relation model instance should use the {@link VcmsTARelation} interface instead.
