 * The model interface for the VcmsArticle service. Represents a row in the &quot;VcmsArticle&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.vportal.portlet.vcms.model.impl.VcmsArticleImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a vcms article model instance should use the {@link VcmsArticle} interface instead.
